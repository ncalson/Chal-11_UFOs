# Chal-11_UFOs

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to develop Dana's webpage on UFO sightings by adding the capability of filtering for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to "date", filters were added for "city", "state", "country", and "shape".

##Results
Visitors on Dana's webpage can now filter the data for 5 different criteria including:
1. Date
2. City
3. State
4. Country
5. Shape

##Summary
A major drawback of this new design is the filter search function only works for exact matches in results, limiting one's findings.

Two recommendations for improvement and/or further development include:
1. The pool of data included on the webpage needs to be expanded.
2. Include drop-down lists for each filter search field.
